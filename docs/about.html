                    <h2>Hey, this is opinionated — in a good way</h2>
                    <p>Look, I made some choices here. Ghostty for the terminal, Starship for the prompt, Claude Code for AI pairing. These aren't the only options out there, but they're what I think works really well together. And honestly? The best part is you can change any of it later if you want. This is just to help you get started without spending a whole day researching terminals.</p>

                    <h2>Vibecoding started with something magical</h2>
                    <p>Remember discovering you could just describe what you wanted and AI would build it? No memorizing syntax, no reading documentation for hours — just having a conversation that somehow turned into working code. That moment was pretty incredible, right?</p>

                    <h2>Then you wanted to go faster</h2>
                    <p>At some point you probably thought "I want to run this on my computer." Test things instantly, iterate without waiting, see what's actually happening in the files. Maybe pair with Claude right in your project, or fix that annoying bug, or just stop having fifteen browser tabs open. Vibecoding in the terminal is faster, and it's kind of fun once you get past the initial "wait, what am I doing" phase.</p>

                    <h2>But getting there feels like a big jump</h2>
                    <p>Traditional coding education is built for people who want to become software engineers. Bootcamps, degrees, months of studying — all great if that's your path! But maybe that's not what you're going for. You're designing, creating, building things with AI. You think about what you want to make, not how to optimize algorithms.</p>
                    <p>The tricky part is that local development is genuinely useful for vibecoding, but the leap from browser prompts to terminal commands can feel pretty overwhelming. It's like being told you need to learn a whole new language just to do what you were already doing.</p>

                    <h2>So I made this to help</h2>
                    <p>This toolkit isn't trying to make you into a software engineer. It's just here to give you what you need for local AI-assisted development without all the stress. One command sets everything up: nice terminal, AI coding help, version control, useful tools. Everything plays nicely together.</p>
                    <p>No agonizing over which terminal to pick. No falling down Reddit rabbit holes about tooling. No configuring things all weekend. Just a good starting point so you can get back to actually building stuff.</p>

                    <h2>You'll learn as you go</h2>
                    <p>The cool thing is, as you keep vibecoding, you'll naturally pick things up. Git will make sense when you're working with someone else. Terminal shortcuts will click when you notice them saving time. You'll tweak things when something doesn't quite fit how you work. And it all happens when you're ready for it, not because someone said you have to learn it now.</p>

                    <h2>This is for people building in new ways</h2>
                    <p>Vibecoding is genuinely different from traditional programming. You don't need to think like a programmer to build things anymore. This toolkit exists because I think the transition to local development should feel natural, not like abandoning everything that makes vibecoding fun in the first place.</p>
                    <p>You're expanding what you can do as a creative person. This just makes that feel easier and more enjoyable.</p>
